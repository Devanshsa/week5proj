		<p class="mb-0">Not to be confused with computer science, computational science is the application of computer science
						and software engineering principles to solve scientific problems. The simulation of physical processes
						can tell us a lot about how they'll behave under certain conditions, which is useful for the study or
						design of physical concepts. Some applications of computational science to engineering are shown below.

							<a href="https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">MATLAB</a> (<strong>Mat</strong>rix <strong>lab</strong>oratory) is a numerical computing enviroment and programming language.
							<br><br>
							Originally developed by computer science chairman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleve_Moler">Cleve Moler</a>
							for his students as an alternative to using FORTRAN (another language suited to scientific and numerical computation), its
							potential was recognised by engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_N._Little">Jack Little</a>. Forming a team
							and founding <a href="https://uk.mathworks.com/">MathWorks</a>, they rewrote MATLAB in C and continued its development into the present day.

							<a href="https://www.solidworks.com/">Solidworks</a> is a computer-aided design and computer aided engineering (CAD and CAE) program for Microsoft Windows.
							<br><br>
							Published by <a href="https://www.3ds.com/en-uk/">Dassault Syst√®mes</a>, the program is used by millions of engineers around the world.
							As well as desiging objects in 2D and 3D, Solidworks provides a variety of tools to analyse
							the behaviour of these designs. A feature that is particularly useful to civil and mechanical
							engineers is the Stress Analysis feature, which lets the user simulate how their design will
							react to an applied stress so it can be designed not to fail.
