			<h1>Applications of computing</h1>
			<h3>An appliation is the action of putting something into operation</h3>
			<p>We live in a society held together by the influence of computers and their seemingly infinite uses.</p>
		<p> In my opinion, the most powerful use of computing within society, lies in all of our day to day activities and it's the mobile phone.</p>
		<p> Not those mobile phones, but instead the era of the smartphone. </p>
