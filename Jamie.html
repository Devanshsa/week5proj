        <p class="mb-0"> There is no place in this page for a lecture on the environment and the effects we have had on
        the planet which we live upon. I will instead, highlight the ways in which computing has had a positive impact
            on our situation and how, without such efforts we would not be able to know what we know.</p>

        <h5>Elon Musk</h5>
        <p>An entrepreneur with a modern twist. Elon has headed projects such as <a href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla</a>
            and <a href="https://https://www.spacex.com//">SpaceX</a>, he is renowned for his open social media effort
            in trying to educate the world on the effects which we are having on our planet. Elon Musk has also gained
            recognition from many climate change researchers for making the prospect of a world transitioning to electric
            cars seem achievable. The Tesla car is an electric car which has the performance qualities of a petrol
            sports car, below is a car review of the most recent Tesla.</p>

                            which lasted for just over four hours after the Falcon Heavy's launch on Tuesday, Feb. 6, 2018.

        <p>We can therefore see that Elon Musk as an individual has been part of a wide-scale project to help improve
        the public image of electric powered cars through Tesla, but also alternative liquid fuel sources through
        SpaceX. I think it is therefore fair to say, that as an individual, Elon Musk has used his access to technology
        to positively impact our climate through not only his inventions but also his social status.</p>

        <h5>Paperless Companies</h5>
        <p>With the ever increasing use of email and electronic communication, paperless offices are now a much more
        common occurrence. For example many banks are swapping to paperless statements, instead of posting your monthly
        statement, they are accessible through a form of online portal which is kept secure within online banking. Many
        retail outlets have begun to phase out paper receipts, replacing them with options to be emailed or sometimes
        stored through your online account. As a combination of these factors there is a reduction in the need for
        logging and deforestation, in order to maintain the stature of our rainforests. These developments, coupled
        with advancements in "Green" computing technologies, such as power management allow companies to rely on these
        technologies without demanding much more in the way of energy.</p>
